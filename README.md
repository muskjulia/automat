# automat
How to run it --> sequentially:
1) Dict_to_dict.py --> converts our downloaded dictionary into a set of words;
2) Beautifier.py --> standardizes all words and removes duplicates.
3) Make_automaton.py --> creates an automaton in two formats: as a tree and as a state machine.
4) Minimize.py --> minimizes the obtained automaton.
5) Metrics.py --> analyzes the data using the automaton. Functions extract information from words.

State --> a technical file that contains classes for use in different files.
